# ðŸš€ Deploy in 2 Minutes - Family First Scheduler

## What This Does
- Deploys your scheduling API to Railway (runs 24/7)
- Sets up a PostgreSQL database automatically
- Gives you a live URL you can access from anywhere

## Step 1: Push to GitHub (Copy & Paste)

Open Terminal and run these commands one by one:

```bash
# 1. Create GitHub repository (you'll be prompted to login)
gh auth login

# 2. Create and push your repository
gh repo create family-first-scheduler-api --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

If `gh` command doesn't work, use this instead:
```bash
# Go to: https://github.com/new
# Create repo named: family-first-scheduler-api
# Then run:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/family-first-scheduler-api.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 2: Deploy to Railway (Just Clicks!)

1. **Open Railway**: https://railway.app

2. **Sign in with GitHub** (use the same account from Step 1)

3. **Click "New Project"**

4. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**

5. **Choose** `family-first-scheduler-api` from the list

6. **Add Database**:
   - Click "New" â†’ "Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL"
   - Railway connects it automatically!

7. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Click on your service

   - Click "Raw Editor"
   - Paste this:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production

   ```

8. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment

9. **Get Your URL**:
   - Go to "Settings" tab
   - Click "Generate Domain"
   - Copy your URL (like `family-first-scheduler-api.up.railway.app`)

## Step 3: Initialize Your Database

Replace `YOUR_URL` with your Railway URL and run:

```bash
# Initialize database with sample data
curl -X POST https://YOUR_URL/api/v1/setup/initialize
```

## Step 4: Test It's Working!

```bash
# Check API health
curl https://YOUR_URL/api/v1/health

# View programs
curl https://YOUR_URL/api/v1/programs

# Generate a year of schedules
curl -X POST https://YOUR_URL/api/v1/advanced-schedules/generate-year \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"facility_id": 1, "start_date": "2025-09-02", "weeks": 52}'
```
